CBM13	Previously known as cellulose-binding domain family XIII (CBD XIII).	pfam00652	CBM	Modules of approx. 150 residues which always appear as a threefold internal repeat. The only apparent exception to this, xylanase II of Actinomadura sp. FC7 (GenBank U08894), is in fact not completely sequenced. These modules were first identified in several plant lectins such as ricin or agglutinin of Ricinus communis which bind galactose residues. The three-dimensional structure of a plant lectin has been determined and displays a pseudo-threefold symmetry in accord with the observed sequence threefold repeat. These modules have since been found in a number of other proteins of various functions including glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. While in the plant lectins this module binds mannose, binding to xylan has been demonstrated in the Streptomyces lividans xylanase A and arabinofuranosidase B. Binding to GalNAc has been shown for the corresponding module of GalNAc transferase 4. For the other proteins, the binding specificity of these modules has not been established. The pseudo three-fold symmetry of the CBM13 module has now been confirmed in the 3-D structure of the intact, two-domain, xylanase of Streptomyces olivaceoviridis.

CBM1	Previously known as cellulose-binding domain family I (CBD I).	pfam00734	CBM	Modules of approx. 40 residues found almost exclusively in fungi. The cellulose-binding function has been demonstrated in many cases, and appears to be mediated by three aromatic residues separated by about 10.4 angstrom and which form a flat surface. The only non-fungal occurence of CBM1 is in an algal non-hydrolytic polysaccharide-binding protein which is composed of four repeated CBM1 modules. Binding to chitin has been demonstrated in one case.

GH7	formerly known as cellulase family C. The cellobiohydrolases of this family act processively from the reducing ends of cellulose chains to generate cellobiose. This is markedly different from the IUBMB definition of cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91), which act from the non-reducing ends of cellulose.	pfam00840	GH	endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4); [reducing end-acting] cellobiohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.-); chitosanase (EC 3.2.1.132); endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.73)

GH61	The enzymes in this family were originally classified as a glycoside hydrolase family based on measurement of very weak endo-1,4-b-D-glucanase activity in one family member. The structure and mode of action of these enzymes are certainly non-canonical and they cannot be considered as bona fide glycosidases. However, they are kept in the CAZy classification on the basis of their capacity to enhance the breakdown of lignocellulose when used in conjunction with a cellulase or a mixture of cellulases.	pfam03443	GH	endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4)

GH48	formerly known as cellulase family L. Some cellobiohydrolases of this family have been reported to act from the reducing ends of cellulose (EC 3.2.1.-), while others have been reported to operate from the non-reducing ends to liberate cellobiose or cellotriose or cellotetraose (EC 3.2.1.-).
