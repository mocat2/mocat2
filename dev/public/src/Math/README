Math::Round -- Perl extension for rounding numbers

Math::Round is a Perl module.  It supplies functions to round numbers,
both positive and negative, in various ways.  This may seem like an
odd thing to write a whole module for, but rounding can sometimes be
a little tricky, so I thought some people might find this useful.

round: round to the nearest integer; numbers ending in .5 go
   "to infinity" (3.5 becomes 4, -3.5 becomes -4)
round_even: round; numbers ending in .5 go to the even number
round_odd: round; numbers ending in .5 go to the odd number
round_rand: round; numbers ending in .5 go up or down randomly

nearest: round to the nearest multiple of any number
nearest_ceil: like nearest; numbers halfway between two multiples
   go up
nearest_floor: like nearest; numbers halfway between two multiples
   go down
nearest_rand: like nearest; numbers halfway between two multiples
   go up or down randomly

nlowmult: next lower multiple of a number
nhimult: next higher multiple of a number
